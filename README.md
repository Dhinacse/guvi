# Sorting
# Bubble Sort
  Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
# Merge Sort
  Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
# Slection Sort
  A sort algorithm that repeatedly searches remaining items to find the least one and moves it to its final location.
# Insertion Sort
  Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
